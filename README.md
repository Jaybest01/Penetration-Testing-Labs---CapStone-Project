# Penetration-Testing-Labs---CapStone-Project
This repository documents a series of controlled penetration testing labs conducted in an isolated environment.   The objective of the labs was to identify, exploit, and document common security vulnerabilities across web applications, file services, and network traffic, and to propose appropriate remediation strategies.
